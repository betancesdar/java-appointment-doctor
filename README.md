The Doctor Appointment Scheduling Application was a tutorial project conducted with students from the Polit√©cnico Padre Zegri as part of a class on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Java. This project served as a practical learning tool to help the students understand OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

The application allowed users to register doctors and patients, schedule appointments, and manage appointment details. Through the project, the students were introduced to core concepts such as creating classes and objects, defining relationships between classes, and implementing functionalities within a structured and modular program. This hands-on approach ensured the students gained a comprehensive understanding of how to design and develop real-world applications using OOP in Java.
